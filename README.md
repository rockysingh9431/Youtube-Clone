## INSTALLATION

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Brief:

This App has been Created Using Libraries Like React and React Redux For storing data and for designing It uses Tailwind and Created a full fledged Youtube App in which I have implemented different Functionalities of Youtube Using Live Google APIs.

## Headlines of the Project

# Implemented Different functionalities of Youtube:

  1. SideBar: Which will be implemented with the help of Redux-store which will work exactly same as in Youtube.

  2. SearchBox: searchBox and its functionalities like Search Results are most Important and most difficult part of this web-App.

           1. Calling API for search Suggestion.
           2. Calling API for SearchResults According to query.
           3. Triggering the redux store to save the searchQuery and At the same time render the SearchVideo Component according to the searchQuery.

  3. MainVideoContainer: This will hold the ButtonList, VideoContainer, WatchPage And SearchVideoContainer all will Render Acccording to the Router.
  4. WatchPage: This will Have a Comment Component So I moved One Step ahead here And Implemented Nested Comments.

       1. Creating Comment Component is also a challenging task here as It needs Recursion to Implement nested Comments.
       2. LiveChat feature: It is the Most Inetresting part of this webApp as it needs good Knowledge of Javscript React and Redux So here knowledge of all three will be tested.
